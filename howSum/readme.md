Write a function `howSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a `targetSum` and an array of `numbers` as arguments.
The function should return an `array` containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the `targetsum`. If there is no combination that adds up to the `targetSum`, then return `null`.
If there are multiple combinations possbile, you may return any single one.
> Note: You can use a number more than one time.

This problem has `O(n*m^2)` time complexity and `O(m^2)` space complexity.
