Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a `targetSum` and an array of `numbers` as arguments.
The function should return an `array` containing the `shortest` combination of numbers that add up to exactly the `targetSum`.
If there is a tie for shortest combination, you may return any of the shortest.
> Note: You can use a number more than one time.

This problem has `O(n*m^2)` time complexity and `O(m^2)` space complexity.
