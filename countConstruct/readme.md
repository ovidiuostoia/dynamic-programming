Write a function `countConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts a `target` string and an `array of strings` as parameters.
The function should return the `number of ways` that the `target` can be constructed by concatenating elements of the `wordBank` array.
> Note: You may reuse elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed.

This problem has `O(n*m^2)` time complexity and `O(m^2)` space complexity.
