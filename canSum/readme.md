Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a `targetSum` and an array of numbers as arguments.
The function should return a `boolean` indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the `targetSum` using numbers from the array.
> Note: You can use a number more than one time.

This problem has `O(m*n)` time complexity and `O(m)` space complexity.
